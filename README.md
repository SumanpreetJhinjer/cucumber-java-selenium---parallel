# cucumber-java-selenium---parallel
This project is extension of cucumber-java-selenium project, in this project I used cucumber java implementation with selenium and JUnit. In this framework I used two really useful plugins Cucable plugin and Cluecumber plugin. Cucable plugin is extremely easy to implement parallel testing, which helps in reducing the time of test execution by almost 70%. The cluecumber plugin is useful in merging the reports generated by different runtime runners and it generates a beautiful detailed report.
